# Sentiment-Anlaysis
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on e-commerce product reviews using Python. The primary goal is to classify user feedback (reviews) into different sentiment categories, such as positive, neutral, or negative. This analysis helps understand customer opinions, enabling better product evaluation and user satisfaction tracking.
# workflow:
Data Loading & Exploration: Understanding the distribution and patterns within review texts and ratings.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization using TF-IDF.
Feature Engineering: Converting cleaned text into numerical format suitable for model training.
Model Building: Training and evaluating classification models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for model assessment.
Visualization: Review length distribution, sentiment class counts, and performance visualizations.
